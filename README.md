# Remove Useless Metaboxes
Removes useless metaboxes on the backend post creation user interface
that non-admin users don't need to see in order to reduce clutter. Specifically,
the metaboxes currently removed for non-admins are:
* Custom Fields
* Essential Grid Custom Options
* Revolution Slider Options (the most useless one since non-admins can't even create new sliders...)
